The Project consisted of replacing a residential pedestrian bridge over Aliso Creek that was damaged as a result of storm events. The pedestrian bridge is utilized by seniors in the Laguna Woods residential development and connects users to the local park. A double 3-foot-high by 7-foot-wide reinforced concrete box replaced the damaged pedestrian bridge. The bridge acts as a grade stabilizer within Aliso Creek. This stabilizer supports the creek’s grade and is important for the protection of an existing 24-inch storm drain located immediately downstream. The bridge has approximately the same flow capacity as the prior crossing. Larger storm events were able to overtop the previous crossing; however, the paths connecting to this new facility are protected from erosion by use of reinforced turf mats.&nbsp;",,General,-117.70776,33.59982,0.11815,Orange,south coast,,1,1,40,25.00,33.33,37.50,63.89,7.5,,100,33.6002,-117.70737,33.59949,-117707998,wgs84,1,perennial,,not recorded,not recorded,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
