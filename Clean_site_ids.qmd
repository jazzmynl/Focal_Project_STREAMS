## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Import Libraries

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Import Data

```{r}
Sites_Raw <- read.csv('_Sites - Overview.csv', skip = 1)
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}

Sites_Raw |> 
  select(c(CRAM.IDS, Site.ID)) |> 
  mutate(CRAM.IDS = strsplit(CRAM.IDS, split = ', ')) |> 
  unnest(CRAM.IDS) |> 
  rename()
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
